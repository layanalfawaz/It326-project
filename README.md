## Project Description:

Our project focuses on analyzing the **Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits (2019â€“2024) dataset.** The main objective is to **classify individuals according to their stress levels** (*Low, Medium, High*) based on lifestyle and demographic features such as **exercise, sleep, and diet.** In addition, we will apply **clustering techniques** to group people with similar habits and explore how these groups relate to different stress outcomes.

## Project Motivation:

The **Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits dataset** has drawn our attention to the increasing concerns around stress and its impact on modern life. Stress affects not only individual well-being but also has broader social and economic consequences. Understanding the lifestyle factors that contribute to stress is essential for improving quality of life and promoting mental health.

By studying and analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify the **primary risk factors and lifestyle patterns** associated with elevated stress levels. Recognizing these patterns can help in creating **preventive strategies**, promoting healthier habits, and supporting individuals in managing stress effectively.

Through this project, we seek to leverage **data-driven insights** to raise awareness, enable early recognition of high-stress groups, and guide informed decision-making for healthier lifestyles and improved mental well-being.
